# namer_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
The application generates cool-sounding names, the user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
